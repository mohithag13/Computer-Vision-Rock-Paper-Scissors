# Computer Vision - Rock-Paper-Scissors Project Guideline
You've probably played rock, paper, scissors before. Perhaps you've used it to decide who pays for dinner or who gets first pick of a team's players. If you're not familiar, rock paper scissors is a two- or more-player hand game. Participants say "rock, paper, scissors," then make their hands into the shapes of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (a palm), or a pair of scissors(two fingers extended) at the same time. 
The rules are simple:
- Rock smashes scissors.
- Paper covers rock.
- Scissors cut paper.
